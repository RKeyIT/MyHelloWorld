**CreateVariables**

    Let's create variables for my programm.
    What a variables we need?

    -   currentCoins = current moneys in account.
    -   payDay = date of general money up.
    -   ??? changeCoins = for add/lose moneys on account for a some time.


**CreateArrays**

    this needs for app history
    -   addedMoneys[]
    -   lessedMoneys[]
    that will be save variable's (changeCoins) 
    and sort this on Added or Lessed group's
    for general calculate it later.


**CreateObjects**

    coins = {
        comment: 'for what',
        amount: number,
        color: green/red (+/-),
    }
